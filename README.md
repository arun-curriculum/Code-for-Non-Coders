#Code for Non Coders

##Share Out
- What is programming and why should I care?
- Should I learn programming or should I hire someone else to do it?
- Come up with two ideas and discuss how technology could make them a reality.

##Typical Web Development Cycle
1. User experience design
2. Information architecture
3. Visual design
4. Development

##Introduction to UX Design
- Two well-known tools:
	- Omnigraffle
	- Balsamiq
- User experience design is all about enhancing user satisfaction while interacting with products.
- It is heavy on research and flow design.

##UX Design Lab
- Take a few minutes to research an online business of your choice.
- Write down at least 5 examples of good UX design, and at least 2 examples of bad UX design / improvements for the product.
- Present to the class your findings. 

##Introduction to Front End Development

#####HTML and CSS
- HTML and CSS work together to create the front end structure and design.
- Front end frameworks and the grid system.

#####JavaScript
- JavaScript helps with page interactions such as animations and dynamic loading of content.
- Datatypes
- Variables
- Functions
- Alerts
- Arrays
- Loops - FOR loop

- [Memory game](https://github.com/arsood/Memory)

##Introduction to Back End Development

#####Introduction
- Why is a back end language needed?
- How do back end languages interact with the front end?
- Back end language examples:
	- Ruby on Rails
	- PHP
	- Python
	- NodeJS

#####Databases
- Difference between SQL and NoSQL databases.
	- MySQL
	- PostgresSQL
	- MongoDB
	- Redis

##Architecture Design Lab

Let's look at some popular sites and determine what technologies could be used. Think about the interaction between backend and frontend and how they fit together.

Your answer doesn't have to be the "right" one (the technology they actually use), but we just want you to demonstrate you understand how each piece fits together. You can choose your own site to analyze, but here are some examples:
- Twitter
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Medium

##Introduction to Algorithms
- Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for various calculations.
- They are generally used for data processing and automated reasoning.
- Algorithms are used in programming to perform calculations useful to the application.
- Examples of algorithms:
	- Search for values in a database by location.
	- Find the shortest path between two points.
	- Determine the most popular songs for a given demographic.
	- Suggest friends that you may know based on certain criteria.

##Algorithm Lab

Problem: Given an array list of letters and/or numbers, how can we find out where a certain value is located?

Sample array:

```
[1, 44, 23, 5, "a", "b", "n", 87, 7]
```

How can we find which place "n" is located?
